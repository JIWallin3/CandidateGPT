Dean Benson Phillips[1] (born January 20, 1969)[2] is an American businessman and politician who has served as the U.S. representative from Minnesota's 3rd congressional district since 2019.[3] Phillips's district encompasses the western suburbs of the Twin Cities, such as Bloomington, Minnetonka, Edina, Maple Grove, Plymouth, and Eden Prairie. A member of the Democratic Party, Phillips has both owned and started several companies in addition to serving as president and CEO of his family's liquor business, the Phillips Distilling Company.[4][5][6] He is the former co-owner of Talenti gelato and co-owns Penny's Coffee. On November 24, 2023, Phillips announced that he would not run for reelection.[7]

First elected in 2018, Phillips defeated six-term Republican incumbent Erik Paulsen.[8] By flipping the previously Republican district, he became the first Democrat to win the seat since 1958. He has since been reelected twice. Phillips is a Democrat who has consistently voted in support of President Joe Biden's positions. With a net worth of $77 million in 2018, Phillips is one of the wealthiest members of Congress.[9] In 2023, he announced his intent to challenge Biden for the Democratic nomination in the 2024 presidential election.[10]
Early life, education, and career

Phillips was born to DeeDee (Cohen) and Artie Pfefer in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1969.[11] Artie was killed in the Vietnam War when Phillips was six months old. DeeDee married Eddie Phillips, heir to the Phillips Distilling Company and the son of advice columnist Pauline Phillips (popularly known as Dear Abby),[12] in 1972. Eddie adopted Dean, who took the last name Phillips.[13]

In the early 1970s, Phillips moved from Saint Paul to Edina. He attended The Blake School.[14]

Phillips graduated from Brown University in 1991 and is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He worked for bicycle equipment and apparel company InMotion for two years, and then joined his family's company's corporate office. He later completed his Master of Business Administration at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management in 2000. After graduation, he was named the president and CEO of his family's organization, Phillips Distilling Company.[12]

Phillips served as the company's president and CEO from 2000 to 2012. He then stepped aside to run one of his other corporate investments, Talenti gelato, until it was sold for an undisclosed amount to Unilever in 2014.[15] In 2016 he founded Penny's Coffee, a coffeeshop chain he still owns, which has two locations in the Twin Cities metropolitan area as of 2022.[15]

Tenure

According to FiveThirtyEight's congressional vote tracker at ABC News, Phillips voted with President Joe Biden's stated public policy positions 100% of the time,[23] making him more liberal than average in the 117th Congress when predictive scoring (district partisanship and voting record) is used.[23] During the start of his first term in 2019, the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University placed him 27th out of 435 members in terms of bipartisanship.[24]

On December 20, 2023, Phillips signed on as a co-sponsor of the Medicare for All Act.[25] This marked a departure from his earlier position on healthcare; he said that he had previously been "convinced through propaganda that [single-payer healthcare] was a nonsensical leftist notion".[26] He cited a confluence of factors that shifted his view in favor of Medicare for All, including his experience caring for his daughter who had been diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, the financial strain of providing health insurance to his employees as a business owner, and the dynamics of representing a congressional district that includes the headquarters of UnitedHealth Group as well as many residents who struggle to access healthcare.[27]

In July 2023, Phillips said he was considering challenging President Joe Biden in the 2024 Democratic presidential primaries.[31] In October 2023, he announced that he would step down as co-chair of the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee because his views on the 2024 presidential race were incongruent with the majority of his caucus.[32] On October 27, in Concord, New Hampshire, he announced a run for the presidency[33] after he officially filed the paperwork with the Federal Election Commission the previous day.[34] Phillips said he would challenge to gain access to the primary ballots of several states where the Democratic Party had excluded him.[35][36]

In January 2024, Phillips floated the idea of putting billionaires Elon Musk and Bill Ackman in cabinet positions during his presidency.[37][38]
